## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of aviation accident data with the aim of assessing the potential risks associated with different types of aircraft. The insights derived from this analysis will guide the company's decision-making process in its new business endeavor of purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.

## Business Problem
The company is diversifying its portfolio by expanding into the aviation industry. However, it lacks knowledge about the potential risks associated with different aircraft. This project is tasked with identifying the aircraft that pose the lowest risk to facilitate the company's entry into this new business venture.

## The Data
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board. It contains information about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters from 1962 to 2023. The choice of data to use, how to handle missing values, aggregate the data, and visualize it in an interactive dashboard is left to the discretion of the data analyst.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly Express

## Data Preparation
The first step in the project is data preparation, which includes loading the aviation data from CSV files, handling missing values, and cleaning and preprocessing the data. This involves tasks such as standardizing categorical data and filling in missing values in specific columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA stage involves analyzing trends and patterns in the data to gain a better understanding of the dataset and derive insights. This includes visualizing the geographical distribution of accidents, investigating the relationship between various factors like weather conditions and accident frequencies, and exploring the distribution of severity categories and engine types involved in accidents.

## Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis is conducted to derive meaningful insights and identify patterns in the data. This includes performing summary statistics for numerical columns and correlation analysis to identify relationships between numerical variables.

## Data Visualization
Data visualization techniques are used to effectively present the findings and communicate insights. This includes creating various types of plots and visualizations to illustrate the distribution of accidents by various factors and exploring correlations between numerical variables.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The analysis provides valuable insights into aviation accidents, including trends, patterns, and factors contributing to accidents. These insights will be translated into three concrete business recommendations to guide the company's decision on which aircraft to purchase. The findings will also be communicated effectively through a storyline that the head of the aviation division can follow, with spotlight visuals that relate directly to the recommendations.
